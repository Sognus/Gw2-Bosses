# GW2 Bosses

GW2 Addon that adds metaevent and core world bosses notification timers to in-game map. 

## Installation
Install via the [Nexus](https://raidcore.gg/Nexus) Addon Library or download the latest `GW2-Bosses.dll` from the [Releases](https://github.com/Sognus/GW2-Bosses/releases) and place in `<Guild Wars 2>/addons`

## Keybinds
`CTRL+SHIFT+B` - Toggle visibility of events on ingame map

`CTRL+SHIFT+O` - Toggle visibility of notification box

## Colors and customization

Currently there is no easy way to customize rendered events, it is a feature planned for future. If you want to change color, open data.json and change `color_hex` value of event which color you want to change. Then unload and load addon again.

## Troubleshooting and feature requests

If you have any issue, want something to change or you desire completely new feature; please always create new github issue and please do that even if I give you OK on other communication platform (like Discord). 

If you happen to encounter any bugs or crashes, before you submit an issue, please try to reset addon's database by deleting its `<GW2 Folder>\addons\World Bosses\data.json`,
should issue persist after reset, please also provide following:
- `<GW2 Folder>\addons\Nexus.log`
- `<GW2 Folder>\addons\arcdps\arcdps.log` (if arcdps is also installed)
- `<GW2 Folder>\addons\arcdps\arcdps_lastcrash.log` (if arcdps is also installed)
